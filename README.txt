======================

``silva.app.photogallery`` provides an additional view to a folder in
`Silva`_ 3.0, that is selectable using a customization marker. It will
display the images inside the folder using a `Gallerific`_
photogallery.

It is a really simple extension, showing off the customization marker
feature available in Silva.
